I wanted to learn about the Android app development and publishing process, so I build this small application as a playground.

<img alt="Input screen" src="/images/Screenshot_2015-06-07-14-28-36.png?raw=true" title="Input screen where the user is asked for a number" width="40%" />
<img alt="Result screen" src="/images/Screenshot_2015-06-07-14-28-39.png?raw=true" title="The user is shown the result of the calculation" width="40%" />
